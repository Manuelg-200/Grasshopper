# Grasshopper
STILL A WORK IN PROGRESS
University project for the course SAW (Sviluppo Applicazioni Web). 
The project consisted of creating a website for a fictional start-up, creating both backend and front-end.
My start-up is a company that sells bags of grass from famous stadiums around the world.
